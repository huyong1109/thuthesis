\begin{abstract}
In the Community Earth System Model (CESM), the ocean model component is computationally expensive for high-resolution grids and is frequently the least scalable component of CESM for certain production experiments. The key problem is that the modified Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) used to solve the barotropic mode scales poorly at the high core counts. We design a fast numerical solver to accelerate the high-resolution ocean simulation. The novel solver adopts a Chebyshev type iterative method to reduce the global communication cost in conjunction with an effective block preconditioner to reduce the iterations further. Comparing with the two origin solvers, it significantly reduces the global communication time and realizes a competitive convergence rate. The experimental results show that the simulation speed of the improved ocean model component with 0.1{\degree}  resolution achieves 10.5 simulated years per wall-clock day on 16,875 cores.
