abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

@article{Liesen2004,
abstract = {One of the most powerful tools for solving large and sparse systems of linear algebraic equations is a class of iterative methods called Krylov subspace methods. Their significant advantages like low memory requirements and good approximation properties make them very popular, and they are widely used in applications throughout science and engineering. The use of the Krylov subspaces in iterative methods for linear systems is even counted among the “Top 10” algorithmic ideas of the 20th century. Convergence analysis of these methods is not only of a great theoretical importance but it can also help to answer practically relevant questions about improving the performance of these methods. As we show, the question about the convergence behavior leads to complicated nonlinear problems. Despite intense research efforts, these problems are not well understood in some cases. The goal of this survey is to summarize known convergence results for three well-known Krylov subspace methods (CG, MINRES and GMRES) and to formulate open questions in this area.
